            I am majoring in Computer Programming and Development, and the creation of this file is part of the CTI-110 Assignment Lab. The reason why I am taking this course is that last year I decided to switch my career from Financing to the IT. I am very excited about everything I am getting to know in the industry, and I feel very happy about the decision I have made about my career.
