            My name is Alex, and I am a student at Wake Technical Community College
        </h1>
        <p>
            I am majoring in Computer Programming and Development, and the creation of this file is part of the CTI-110 Assignment Lab. 
            The reason why I am taking this course is that last year I decided to switch my career from Financing to the IT. 
            Althought it is just the beginning of my major path, I am very excited about everything I am getting to know in the industry, and I feel very happy about the decision I have made about my career.
            I am also learning Python and some of the Linux environment in parallel with the Wake Technnical course. 
            When I have free time between the studies, I like to play soccer, tennis, and hike with my wife. Also, I really like to cooking for friends and family.
