2. This is my GitHub personal account. I have created that account at August 26, 2022. This account is my space at GitHub website where I can save all my repositories.

3. By following the steps of GitHub Lab in the Web, Pgm, & Db Foundation class at Wake Technical Community College, I have created a repository of my GitHub Pages. It is a website for me and my personal projects. Also, it is hosted directly from my GitHub repository, so I just need to make a push after any sort of edition I make for the changes be live.

4. I have used GitHub Desktop to clone my repository to my local computer. GitHub Desktop is a more welcoming software to deal with the process os cloning and pushing the repository. I made the download of the software directly at GitHub website (desktop.github.com). After the download and instalation of the software, I logged in my GitHub account. At the first screen post login of GitHub Desktop, I have clicked on "Click Repository", and GitHub Pages listed all my repositories for selection.
